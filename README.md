# African AI Cloud — Learning Project
Exploring a tiny “my-own-AWS” using Linux + automation.  
This is a **learning project**, not a commercial product.

## Proof-of-Concept Ladder
1️⃣ SSH to a server  
2️⃣ Deploy a demo app  
3️⃣ Run an AI agent  
4️⃣ Build a 3-node cluster  
5️⃣ Migrate HeartPattern (current milestone)  
6️⃣ Serve external users (future)  
7️⃣ Explore quantum (long term)

## Current Focus
- 3-node RHEL/KVM cluster  
- Basic agent for VM provisioning  
- Local AI inference (Ollama / Llama)  
- Plan HeartPattern migration from AWS  

## Structure
- `docs/` — setup, plans, audit/migration notes  
- `weekly-log/` — progress entries  

> “Start with one rack, one idea, and curiosity. See where it leads.”
