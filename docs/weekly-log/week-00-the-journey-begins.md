# Week 0: From Cloud Architect to Infrastructure Engineer

## The Spark

Two days ago: "I want to learn RHCSA"
Today: Deployed production-grade Kubernetes across VMware cluster

Not bad for someone who couldn't remember their Windows password 72 hours ago.

## The Journey So Far

### Day 1: The Struggle
- Locked out of old laptop
- No USB drive for RHEL install
- VirtualBox won't work (disk space)
- POST errors, CMOS battery dead

Solution: Fuck it, we pivot.
- Found Red Hat Developer Sandbox (cloud RHEL)
- Got hands-on immediately
- Started practicing commands

### Day 2: Meeting Dave
- Mentor: Dave (Red Hat System Administrator)
- His setup: 3-node VMware cluster, enterprise hardware
- First lesson: Hypervisor clustering, vertical vs horizontal scaling
- Realized: I've been working 8 years without understanding infrastructure

### Day 3: The Deployment
- Deployed 3 VMs: OpenShift across VMware
- Resources: 48 vCPUs on 8 physical cores (overcommitment!)
- Network: VLAN 102 isolation
- Platform: Production-grade container orchestration

Dave's secret: "Proper caching is the secret to proper infrastructure"

My realization: This is why Heart Pattern is slow.

## The Gap I'm Filling

8 years as Microsoft Solution Architect:
- Data/AI focus (Azure ML, Synapse, Databricks)
- Always worked in cloud abstractions
- Never touched bare metal
- Designed "solutions" worth millions
- Didn't understand the infrastructure underneath

The problem:
- Can recommend Azure services ✅
- Can't size resources properly ❌
- Can troubleshoot API issues ✅
- Can't find infrastructure bottlenecks ❌
- Can design architectures ✅
- Can't optimize costs effectively ❌

## What I'm Learning

Week 1 Focus: Infrastructure Fundamentals
- Resource planning (CPU, memory, storage)
- Overcommitment strategies (more VMs than physical resources)
- Caching architectures (Redis, CDN, application-level)
- Network isolation (VLANs, security)
- Platform delivery (making infrastructure usable)
- Automation (Ansible, kickstart, OpenShift)

## The Bigger Vision

This isn't just about passing RHCSA:

Phase 1: Learn infrastructure (now)
Phase 2: Migrate Heart Pattern from AWS (Week 9-16)
Phase 3: Build African AI infrastructure
Phase 4: Add quantum computing (years out)

Goal: African tech sovereignty
- Data stays on continent
- Solar-powered data centers
- Open-source infrastructure
- Cost-effective cloud alternative
- Train African engineers

## The Wake-Up Call

Built Heart Pattern with AI tools (Cursor, v0, Bolt):
- Beautiful UI: ✅
- Working backend: ✅
- Terrible performance: ❌

Why? No caching, no optimization, no infrastructure knowledge.

AI tools teach you to BUILD fast.
They don't teach you to BUILD RIGHT.

That's the gap I'm filling.

## Week 1 Goals

Technical:
- Master Day 1 RHCSA commands
- Understand datacenter deployment patterns
- Deploy and configure OpenShift
- Learn Redis caching fundamentals

Documentation:
- GitHub repos active and maintained
- Weekly progress logs
- Architecture diagrams
- Lessons learned

Business:
- Plan Heart Pattern migration
- Calculate cost savings
- Design caching architecture
- Prepare investor materials (future)

## The Timeline

Weeks 0-8: RHCSA fundamentals + Dave mentorship
Weeks 9-16: Heart Pattern migration (proof of concept)
Months 5-8: First 5 paying customers (MVP)
Months 9-18: Scale to 50 customers (multi-location)
Year 3+: African quantum infrastructure

## Why This Matters

Too many developers (including past me):
- Build with AI tools
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- Assume it's "production-ready"
- Wonder why performance is terrible
- Don't understand infrastructure fundamentals

This is the gap.
This is what I'm fixing.
This is what I'll teach others.

## The Mindset

From Dave: "The underlying OS doesn't matter - what matters is: Can you automate it?"

My translation: Stop clicking. Start understanding. Automate everything.

## Resources This Week

- Red Hat Developer Sandbox (cloud RHEL 9)
- Dave's VMware cluster (hands-on)
- OpenShift deployment experience
- Infrastructure fundamentals learning

## Next Week

- Continue RHCSA command practice
- Deeper dive on caching strategies
- OpenStack introduction
- Heart Pattern performance audit
- Architecture diagrams

## Quote to Remember

Dave: "Proper caching is the secret to proper infrastructure"

This explains EVERYTHING about why Heart Pattern is slow.
This is what AI coding tools don't teach.
This is production reality.

Status: Week 0 complete. Foundation set. Let's build.
