# Cloud Provider Economics: How Overcommitment Works

## The Business Model

Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) make 70-80% gross margins by selling more resources than they physically have. This is called **overcommitment** and it's not fraud - it's smart business based on utilization patterns.

## The Math

### Physical Server Example
- Hardware: 48 CPU cores, 384 GB RAM
- Cost: ~$580/month (hardware, power, facility)

### What AWS Sells
- 10× m5.xlarge instances (4 vCPU, 16 GB each)
- Total sold: 40 vCPUs on 48 physical cores
- Overcommit ratio: Conservative (under 1:1 on aggregate)
- Revenue: $1,400/month
- Profit: $820/month (59% margin)

### Aggressive Overcommit
- 48 physical cores
- Sell 192-288 vCPUs (4-6:1 ratio)
- Works because: VMs idle 80-95% of time
- Revenue: $2,000-3,000/month
- Profit: $1,420-2,420/month (71-81% margin)

## Why It Works

1. **Workload Patterns**: Most VMs use <10% CPU average
2. **Burstable Nature**: Apps burst briefly, then idle
3. **Statistical Multiplexing**: Unlikely all VMs peak simultaneously
4. **Hypervisor Scheduling**: Fairly allocates CPU when contention occurs

## Our Advantage

### Cost Structure
- Used hardware: $140/month (vs AWS $417)
- Solar power: $10/month (vs AWS $36.50)
- Minimal overhead: $35/month (vs AWS $125)
- **Total: $185/month vs AWS $580/month**

### Pricing Strategy
- AWS equivalent: $140/month
- Our price: $70/month (50% savings)
- Our cost: $18.50/month (per instance)
- Our margin: 74% (higher than AWS!)

### Why We Win
✅ Lower operating costs (solar, used hardware)
✅ No corporate overhead
✅ Local latency advantage (10-20× faster)
✅ Data sovereignty compliance
✅ Transparent pricing (no hidden overcommit)

## The Opportunity

African founders pay AWS/Azure prices designed for 70-80% margins.

We can offer:
- 50% cost savings
- Better performance (local latency)
- Data sovereignty
- **Still maintain 70%+ margins**

This is the arbitrage opportunity.
